# Capstone 2 Bakery API using Node, Express and MongoDB for Zuitt

### [API link on AWS ec2 as provided by Zuitt](http://ec2-54-254-9-166.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4010/products/active)

This is my Capstone 2 project that was made as a requirement for Back end course on Zuitt.

It was quite a process and we were only required to make an MVP. I added and refactored a lot after the submission to mimic or adapt it based on the react app.

I used dotenv vault for this one. The developer of dotenv and vault mentioned and recommended that using the vault would add another layer of security for the secrets that were used on the app.

I had some trouble trying to find a hosting site to publish the API but settled for Render as it was quick and easy.

Overall, the process was challenging and enjoyable once I see its effects on the front end.
